* alignment of protein to transcripts

Converting protein to transcript alignments to CDS to transcript alignment, by
multiplying the AA coordinates by three handles spliced codons once mapped to
genome.

Initially approach was to align proteins to both canonical and non-canonical
transcripts and pick the best alignments.  However, there were a number of
discrepancies in the non-canonical transcript alignments.  This was change to
only align to canonical and then project these alignments to the non-canonical
transcripts, which resulted in a significant improvement.

Alignments are done to canonical transcript where the UTR is hard-masked to
prevent alignment into UTR.  Projection to non-canonical transcripts have
UTR projection trimmed.

Both BLAT protein to DNA and TBLASTN were tried to align the UniProt
proteins.  When aligning only to the canonical transcript, the difference
were negligible.
