* read-through genes not handled well


* JC:
I'm looking at ZNF91, say ENST00000300619.12 (I think that's the right number of 0s).  You can find a chunk at chr19:23,359,411-23,361,872.  It looks like you don't map any zinc fingers for the first roughly 2.4kb of that exon, whereas PFAM and the cross-mapped Uniprot domains do report them there.  Are you more confident in your mappings?
